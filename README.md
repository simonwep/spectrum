### What is this?

This is a small audio spectrum analyzer that I created after realizing that [spek](https://github.com/alexkay/spek) is no longer actively maintained.
I also wondered if it was possible to make it more performant and portable.
To achieve both performance and cross-platform compatibility, this has become a PWA and uses the browser's native audio API (which is fast!).

I'd say, pick any audio file and [try it out](https://spectrum.reinisch.io) :)
