### What is this?

This is a small audio spectrum analyzer that I made after I realized that [spek](https://github.com/alexkay/spek) is no longer actively maintained.
I also wondered if it was possible to make it more performant and portable.
To get both performance and cross-platform compatibility this has become a PWA and is using the browsers native audio API (which is fast!).
Unfortunately not all browsers support things like the [OfflineAudioContext](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/OfflineAudioContext) I need, therefore it only works
on chromium-based browsers.

I'd say, pick any audio file and [try it out](https://spectrum.reinisch.io) :)

### Features

* âš¡ Fast - we're using native web API's.
* ðŸ”½ Installble - it's a PWA!
* âŒ¨ Shortcuts - downloading the graph or changing decibel levels, there's a shortcut for it.
* âœ¨ Minimalistic - does one job, as good as possible. Just a few kilobytes of JS and CSS are served.
* ðŸ”´ Realtime audio support.
